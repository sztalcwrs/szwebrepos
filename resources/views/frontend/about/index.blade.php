    <p class="text-xl mb-3">Welcome to Sardar Zadran Veterinarians Medications & Chicken Trade! We are a company in
        Afghanistan that helps
        take care of pets and chickens.</p>
    <p class="text-xl mb-3">We make special medicines for pets, like dogs and cats. These medicines are easy for them to
        take, and most vets
        in Afghanistan trust us to give these medicines to their furry patients. We want all pets to feel better and
        stay healthy.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl mb-3">We also sell food for baby chickens and grown-up chickens. We know how important it is to
        keep chickens strong
        and healthy, so we have special medicines for them too. This helps the farmers take care of their chickens and
        make sure they grow up to be strong and happy.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl mb-3">Our mission is to help all the animals in Afghanistan live a good life. We work closely with
        vets and farmers to
        make sure every animal gets the best care possible.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl mb-3">Join us in our mission to make Afghanistan a better place for our animal friends. Together,
        we can make a big
        difference!
    </p>
